# password_generator

A webpage in which the user can press the 'generate password' button and be presented with a series of prompts for their desired password criteria; ex. How many characters they would like to be included, would they like numbers or special characters included, etc. 

## Motivation

In a world where our sensitive data is stored entirely online, it is so important to make sure that strong passwords are available to the user in order to increase security guarding that data. There is an unprecedented amount of information theft through cyber-hacking. With a password generator built right in to a company's website/application, it makes it that much easier for employees and users of the application to get access to a randomized password that they don't have to spend time constructing themselves.
